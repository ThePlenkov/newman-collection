# Newman/Postman collection generator

> \${DESCRIPTION}

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

## Install

```bash
npm i -S newman-collection
```

## Usage

The only feature this module brings is simplified JS-like creation of the collection file. Postman is a great service and the app is amazing but it doesn't fit any automation scenarios without paid subscription plan and established integrations.

Newman was developed by a postman team to make it cli-based and it can work with existing collections by filename or URL. There is also [postman-collection][postman-collection] module which is designed to work with collection as with a model. However even with this module code looked quite complicated.
